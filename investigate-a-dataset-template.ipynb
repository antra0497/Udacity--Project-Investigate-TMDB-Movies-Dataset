    "> **For a Movie to be in successful criteria**\n",
    "> 1. Average Budget must be around 60 millon dollar\n",
    "> 2. Average duration of the movie must be 113 minutes \n",
    "> 3. Any one of these should be in the cast :Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, Sylvester Stallone,Cameron Diaz\n",
    "> 4. Genre must be : Action, Adventure, Thriller, Comedy, Drama.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> By doing all this the movie might be one of the hits and hence can earn an average revenue of around 255 million  dollar.This analysis was done considering the movies which had a significant amount of profit of around 50 million dollar. This might not be completely error free but by following these suggestion one can increase the probability of a movie to become a hit. \n"
